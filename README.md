# QR Hunt Scanner
## Introduction
This repository is a custom scanner developed by me to conduct QR hunts. The first one will be conducted at Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya's annual tech fest, Epitome'23, on March 25, 2023, at GSV Campus, Vadodara, Gujarat, as an intracollege event. Here are details regarding the repository for various people using it or viewing the code.
## QR Quest: The Crusade
QR Quest is one of the most anticipated events of Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya's tech fest, Epitome'23. It is an innovative take on the classic treasure hunt that is sure to take your breath away. The event is designed to challenge your problem-solving and analytical skills as you navigate through clues in the form of QR codes. The codes will lead you on a thrilling adventure where you'll encounter audio-visual clues that will leave you spellbound. This event is a fantastic opportunity to test your knowledge and tech-savvy skills and to put them to the test in a fun and interactive way. The maximum number of teams is 18, and each team must consist of 5 members.\
## For players:
The game will proceed in 5 rounds. Teams will eliminate one by one until two teams remain in round 4 and round 5 will be the decider. Here are some general rules we expect the players to follow.
- Each team will be provided with their unique passkey that they will use throughout the game. They will have to enter the passkey after each scan. Players are not allowed to share their key with anyone or use any other team's key.
- No QR codes are hidden outside the college campus, inside buildings, near electrical appliances, in restricted areas, in dense flora or any other dangerous areas. Thus, entering such areas is strictly prohibited.
- Players must obey all traffic and pedestrian laws and be mindful of their surroundings. Players must not damage or vandalize any property in the process of completing the quest. Players must not hurt flora and fauna of the campus while playing.
- Indiscipline and violence will be strictly not tolerated. Not only the team will be disqualified, there are chances of disciplinary action will be taken against the participants.
- Participants (in the game and outside the game) should not help anyone besides their own team. This will result in instant disqualification.
- Players must stay together as a team at all times.
- Each team will have a volunteer from the organising committee to enforce these rules. Team actions maybe recorded. Misbehaviour with any member of the organising committee will lead to disqualification even if the team has won already.
- All the teams participating should return to the starting point with all the QRs collected in the game, even if they are eliminated.
- In any circumstances, decision of the organising committee will be final and should not be questioned. By playing the game, participants agree to follow and abide all the above mentioned rules. 

Here is the game plan. Players are expected to understand it and then come.
- **Round 1:** In this round, 18 teams will exist. Each team will be handed out a QR code which bears a clue to the next QR. Players should scan the QR with the scanner given (this repository) and reach to the next clue. They should enter their passkey and follow to the next clue. The clue will not be displayed until the decided time of the rounds.
- **Round 2:** In this round, total 8 teams will be selected from round 1 based on who will scan the QR first. Out of 18, 6 teams will qualify in this round. The qualified teams can scan their QR multiple times. 2 extra teams will be added in the round as wild card entries which will be amongst the 12 teams that got eliminated in round 1. In this round, the clue will appear on the scanner like the previous one and teams should run for the 8 QRs placed all over the campus.
- **Round 3:** As the game proceeds the game will only have 4 teams now, half of the previous round. The format remains the same - scan the QR, get to the location, and find the next QR. The team which reaches first gets to stay! This round will have increased difficulty.
- **Round 4:** This round will give us our last 2 teams. Teams that managed to survive despite of such difficult clues and truly knew the campus. The teams should return to the initial location for the final round.
