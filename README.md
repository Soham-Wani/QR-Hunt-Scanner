# QR Hunt Scanner
## Introduction
This repository is a custom scanner developed by me to conduct QR hunts. The first one will be conducted at Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya's annual tech fest, Epitome'23, on March 25, 2023, at GSV Campus, Vadodara, Gujarat, as an intracollege event. Here are details regarding the repository for various people using it or viewing the code.
## QR Quest: The Crusade
QR Quest is one of the most anticipated events of Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya's tech fest, Epitome'23. It is an innovative take on the classic treasure hunt that is sure to take your breath away. The event is designed to challenge your problem-solving and analytical skills as you navigate through clues in the form of QR codes. The codes will lead you on a thrilling adventure where you'll encounter audio-visual clues that will leave you spellbound. This event is a fantastic opportunity to test your knowledge and tech-savvy skills and to put them to the test in a fun and interactive way. The maximum number of teams is 18, and each team must consist of 5 members.\
## For players:
The game will proceed in 5 rounds. Teams will eliminate one by one until two teams remain in round 4 and round 5 will be the decider. Here are some general rules we expect the players to follow.
- Each team will be provided with their unique passkey that they will use throughout the game. They will have to enter the passkey after each scan. Players are not allowed to share their key with anyone or use any other team's key.
- No QR codes are hidden outside the college campus, inside buildings, near electrical appliances, in restricted areas, in dense flora or any other dangerous areas. Thus, entering such areas is strictly prohibited.
- Indiscipline and violence will be strictly not tolerated. Not only you will be disqualified, there are chances of disciplinary action will be taken against the participants.
- Participants (in the game and outside the game) should not help anyone besides their own team. This will result in instant disqualification.
- Each team will have a volunteer from the organising committee to enforce these rules. Team actions maybe recorded. Misbehaviour with any member of the organising committee will lead to disqualification even if the team has won already.

Here is the game plan. Players are expected to understand it and then come.
